# Retail Sales Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a retail sales dataset using Python and statistical techniques. The goal of the analysis is to understand sales patterns, customer demographics, and product performance, and to derive insights that can support data-driven business decisions.

## Objectives
- Clean and prepare retail sales data for analysis
- Perform descriptive statistical analysis to understand key variables
- Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques
- Explore customer demographics and purchasing behavior
- Visualize insights using charts and heatmaps

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and validation
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode)
- Daily, weekly, and monthly sales trend analysis
- Customer segmentation by age and gender
- Product category performance analysis
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps

## Key Insights
- Sales trends vary across different time periods, with noticeable fluctuations over time
- Certain age groups contribute more significantly to total sales
- Product categories differ in performance and customer demand
- Customer purchasing behavior shows patterns linked to age and gender
